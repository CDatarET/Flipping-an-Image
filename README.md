Leetcode Problem #832. Flip an "Image" made of an array[][] consisting of 1's and 0's. 

# Flip and Invert Image

Given an `n x n` binary matrix `image`, the task is to:

1. **Flip the image horizontally** – Reverse each row in the matrix.
2. **Invert the image** – Replace every `0` with `1`, and every `1` with `0`.

Return the resulting image after performing both operations.
